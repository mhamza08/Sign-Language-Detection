# Sign-Language-Detection

There have been several advancements in technology and a lot of research has been done to help the people who are deaf and dumb. Aiding the cause, Deep learning, and computer vision can be used too to make an impact on this cause.

This can be very helpful for the deaf and dumb people in communicating with others as knowing sign language is not something that is common to all, moreover, this can be extended to creating automatic editors, where the person can easily write by just their hand gestures.

A machine learning enabled sign language detection and communication system that works effectively and allows all impaired individuals to study and educate themselves.

This sign language detection model can be used in hospitals to communicate between patients and doctors to treat disabled people who are blind and deaf.

Libraries used:-

1.	OpenCv - OpenCV is library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision. It has been used for processing images and videos to identify objects, faces etc.  
2.	OS - The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Pythonâ€™s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality. The *os* and *os.path* modules include many functions to interact with the file system.
3.	uuid - Universal Unique Identifier, is a python library which helps in generating random objects of 128 bits as ids. It provides the uniqueness as it generates ids on the basis of time, Computer hardware
4.	time - The Python time module provides many ways of representing time in code, such as objects, numbers, and strings. It also provides functionality other than representing time, like waiting during code execution and measuring the efficiency of your code.
5.	tensorflow  - tensorflow is used throughout the model for importing and exporting files, creating test and train dataset, object detection model, and provides control with features like the Keras Functional API.
6.	object_detection - tensorflow API abject_detection makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models. It is build on top of tensorflow module and help is used throughout the model development..
